package anti_entropy

// This anti-entropy module should be relegated to a daemon that runs in the background at each node.
// This function should then be called at regular intervals.
// Frequency of the anti-entropy repair operation is a configurable knob that can be tuned.
// We leave tuning out of the scope of this project, since that would take quite a significant amount of time.
// For testing and demonstration purposes, we can manually trigger the execution of this anti-entropy repair procedure.
